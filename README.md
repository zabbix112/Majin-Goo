# HoneyCloud
A destined replacement for HoneyDrive (albeit inspired by). 

Since HoneyDrive does not seem to be getting an update anytime soon, a 2018 variant is needed. 
Enter: HoneyCloud

Ubuntu 16.04 - Installed
Elastic Stack to display all the useful logs captured by the pots (Forward to centralized log server maybe?)
wazuh elastic search template may have failed
logstash complete
kibana failing due to version issues waiting until resolved.

Isolated Honeypots: 
Cowrie
Dionaea
Honeyd
Snare/Tanner
Shadow Daemon
Honeypress
Conpot
Artillery (Look into further, may be redundant)
Shiva - Spam
Bluepot (May have to fix up)
Honeycomb ---> Need to make a newer version to include all sorts of Honeypots for auto signature generation for IDS/IPS.

Looking for:
Windows IOT Open Source Honeypot - No open source projects, may have to build own. 
Android Honeypot
Android Auto Honeypot
Automotive Grade Linux Honeypot - What services do hackers look for in cars? What points of entry?

TBD: 
The many security tools and exact architecture. 
Complete - Wireshark, Tshark, ntop

Coming soon - Recon-ng at least

Considering adding Snort 

This is not even in Alpha, this is me jotting down my ideas. 
But feel free to contact me regardless if you wish to help on this.

This is quickly becoming a large project. Icon coming soon by Supriya. 

Currently plan to make a master that is all in one, and then a fork that works well with the newest Security Onion and Elastic Stack. May as well just have one Elastic Stack Console. Obviously everyone has a different case and need, so why not both?
