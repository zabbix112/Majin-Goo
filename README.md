# HoneyCloud
A destined replacement for HoneyDrive (albeit inspired by). 

Since HoneyDrive does not seem to be getting an update anytime soon, a 2018 variant is needed. 
Enter: HoneyCloud

Ubuntu 17.10
Elastic Stack to display all the useful logs captured by the pots (Forward to centralized log server maybe?)
Honeypots: 
Cowrie
Dionaea
Honeyd
Snare/Tanner
Shadow Daemon
Django-Admin-Honeypot
Honeypress
Conpot
Hale
UDPot
Shiva
Bluepot
Honeycomb ---> Need to make a newer version to include all sorts of Honeypots for auto signature generation for IDS/IPS.

Looking for:
Windows IOT Open Source Honeypot
Android Honeypot
Android Auto Honeypot
Automotive Grade Linux Honeypot

TBD: 
The many security tools and exact architecture. 

This should sit behind an IDS/IPS and Firewall at the least to simulate a real environment. 

This is not even in Alpha, this is me jotting down my ideas. 
But feel free to contact me regardless.
